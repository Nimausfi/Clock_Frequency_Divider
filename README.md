# Clock Frequency Divider

What is a **Clock Divider**?


A clock divider is a circuit that has an input signal of a frequency (fin) and produces an output signal of a frequency (fout), where fout = fin/n and ''n'' is an integer. 


Frequency dividers can be used both for analog and digital applications. However, analog frequency dividers are less common and used only at very high frequencies. Digital dividers applied in modern IC technologies can operate to tens of GHz.
