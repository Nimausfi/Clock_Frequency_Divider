# Clock Frequency Divider

What is a **clock Divider**?


A clock divider is a circuit that takes an input signal of a frequency fin and generates an output signal of a frequency fout, where fout = fin / n and ''n'' is an integer. 



Frequency dividers are used for both analog and digital applications. 


Analog frequency dividers are less common and used only at very high frequencies. Digital dividers implemented in modern IC technologies can work up to tens of GHz.
